# Marketplace
Welcome to the Marketplace project! This project is a full-stack application built with the `MERN` (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It consists of three main applications:

1. **Dashboard**: A React application designed for administrators to manage the database and oversee the operations of the marketplace.
2. **Marketplace**: The front-end of the e-shop, built using React.js, where users can browse products, make purchases, and interact with the platform.
3. **Server**: An Express.js server with MongoDB connection serving as the backend of the marketplace, handling requests from the frontend applications and managing the database.


## Features
### Dashboard:
- Admin authentication and authorization.
- CRUD operations for managing products, orders, and users.
### Marketplace:
- Browse products by category or search.
- Add products to the cart and complete purchases.
### Server:
- RESTful API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend.
- MongoDB integration for storing and retrieving data.
- Dockerized deployment for easy scaling and management.
